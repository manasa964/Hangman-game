#  OBJECTIVE OF OUR CHATBOT:

  The main objective of this chatbot is to build a program which helps to play hangman game..

#  WHAT DOES OUR CHATBOT DO:

Our code will generate a word which has to be guessed by the player. So, that the output screen will displays out blanks (short lines) for each letter of a word. Then the player will guess a letter. If the letter is in the word(s) then the project will write the letter at everyplace it appears. If the letter isn't in the word then we cross out the lifelines (which are usually a finite no. of chances) from the list. The player will continue guessing the letters until he can either solve the word or the chances come to over. When he guessed all the correct letter he wins by printing the word else loses the game by printing hangman stages.
